# About
I am passionate about capturing moments.

## Current gears
I have recently started getting into photography with professional gears.

Here are my current gears:
* Camera Body: Canon 6D Mark I
* Lenses: 
  * Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS
  * Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM
* Flash: Canon 600EX RT

Besides main body, I like to take quick snaps with what I have with me, 
and 90% of the time it's my smart phone.
* Phone: Pixel 2 XL

Other than the phone, I sometime use pocket camera for light shoots or events.
* Sony RX-100 Mark I
