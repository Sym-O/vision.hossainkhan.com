## I live to eat!
Besides taking random shots, I love trying our different cuisine. In other words you can call me "foodie".
I may forget many things, but I never* forget to take picture of my food.

Here are some of the snapshots that I can find.


You can also follow me on Google Maps, I am a `Level 7` local guide.

<small>* _Clarification, when I am hungry and food is too good, I forget to take snap, but I don't forget to take picture of empty plate after I am done._ 😂</small>
