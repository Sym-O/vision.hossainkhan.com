## Mind is like sky
Everyday gives us unique opportunity to view our surrounding differently. The sky constantly sifts and gives us millions combination of views.
I get excited with the the views it create, specially during sunset. Because, every second it shows different color.

This is a random view from my balcony before the sunset.
